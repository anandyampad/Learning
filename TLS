There are two types of Encryptions
    1. Asymmetric Encryptions
    2. Symmetric Encryptions

Asymmetric Encryptions
    In asymmetric Encryption, Two keys are used. Public key and Private Key.
    The server generates private and public keys and shares the Public key with the Client(Browser).

    The client uses Public Key to encrypt Content and sends it across the network. The server decrypts this content using its private key.

Symmetric Encryptions
    In Symmetric Encryptions, Only one key is used.
    The client and server used a single key o encrypt and decrypt data.


TLS/SSL
Generic Flow

SKEY => Session Key
PUBKEY => Public Key
PRIKEY => Privite Key

    Client              ----          `  Server creates Public(PUBKEY) and Privite(PRIKEY) keys                                ----             Server
    Client              <---             Server  shares PUBKEY with Client                                                     <---             Server
    Client              ----             Client Creates Single Session(SKEY) Key                                               ----             Server
    Client              --->             Client Encrypts SKEY with Servers PUBKEY and sends to Server                          --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server Uses PRIKRY to decrypt the SKEY, which is sent by the Client                   --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server and Client communicates with shared SKEY until it won't expire                 ----             Server
    Client              --->             Client sends data by encrypting it with SKEY                                          --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server Decrypts data by using SKEY                                                    ----             Server
    Client              <---             Server Sends data by encrypting using SKEY                                            <---             Server
    Client              ----             Client Decrypts data by using SKEY                                                    ----             Server




Public Key(PUBKEY) is shared as Certificate. This certificate will be signed by CA(Certificate Authority).
The receiver will have the CA public key to validate the certificate. 


Webserver(WS) first time adopting HTTPS:
CA's will have their own Public Key and Private Key. For example, Goggle CA(GCA) Will have its Private and Public Key.
WS will generate Public Key and Private Key.
WS will create CSR(Certificate Signing Request) with their Public and Private Key. And Requests GCA to Sign this.

GCA will sign this with its Private Key and Sends back to WS. This signed artifact is called a "Certificate".

CA => Certificate Authority 
Certificate => Actual Certificate Containing Servers Public Key.
CSR => Certificate signing Request, This request will be issued to receive a certificate from CA.

Open SSL:

Create Key Pair:
Check for the version in your Working ENV: "openssl version -a"
Generating Key Pair with RSA algorithm and 2048 Key length: "openssl genrsa -out mytesting.key 2048"
This will give mytesting.key, And includes both public key and private key.

Need to extract the public key and private key from this key pair: "openssl rsa -in mytest.key -pubout -out mytest_pub.key"

```
ANANDK4-M-40W4:TLS anandk4$ openssl genrsa -out mytest.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus

writing RSA key
ANANDK4-M-40W4:TLS anandk4$ ls

Create Certificate Signing Request(CSR): "openssl req -new -key mytest.key -out mytest.csr"
```
ANANDK4-M-40W4:TLS anandk4$ openssl req -new -key mytest.key -out mytest.csr
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

For Self Signing the Certificate: "openssl x509 -in mytest.csr -out mytest.crt -req -signkey mytest.key -days 365"
```
ANANDK4-M-40W4:TLS anandk4$ ls
