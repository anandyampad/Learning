There are two types of Encryptions
    1. Asymmetric Encryptions
    2. Symmetric Encryptions

Asymmetric Encryptions
    In asymmetric Encryption, Two keys are used. Public key and Private Key.
    The server generates private and public keys and shares the Public key with the Client(Browser).

    The client uses Public Key to encrypt Content and sends it across the network. The server decrypts this content using its private key.

Symmetric Encryptions
    In Symmetric Encryptions, Only one key is used.
    The client and server used a single key o encrypt and decrypt data.


TLS/SSL
Generic Flow

SKEY => Session Key
PUBKEY => Public Key
PRIKEY => Privite Key

    Client              ----          `  Server creates Public(PUBKEY) and Privite(PRIKEY) keys                                ----             Server
    Client              <---             Server  shares PUBKEY with Client                                                     <---             Server
    Client              ----             Client Creates Single Session(SKEY) Key                                               ----             Server
    Client              --->             Client Encrypts SKEY with Servers PUBKEY and sends to Server                          --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server Uses PRIKRY to decrypt the SKEY, which is sent by the Client                   --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server and Client communicates with shared SKEY until it wont expire                 ----             Server
    Client              --->             Client send data by encrypting it with SKEY                                          --->             Server
    Client              ----             Server Decrypts data by using SKEY                                                    ----             Server
    Client              <---             Server Sends data by encrypting using SKEY                                            <---             Server
    Client              ----             Client Decrypts data by using SKEY                                                    ----             Server
